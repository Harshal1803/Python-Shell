2. ls,pwd,cd,mkdir and other basic commands which work flawlessly.
3. '**systeminfo**' command for showing all cpu details.
4. Session logging, history management, or command auto-completion.
5. Fully functional on Windows, with potential future expansion for macOS and Linux support.
6. Designed for speed and low resource consumption, ensuring smooth operation on older machines.
7. **NEW UPDATE**---- added git functionalities(git push ,pull ,add, clone, init).

## How to use it?
1. It is as simple as the normal terminal, just download **main.exe** from the 'releases' section.
2. After that, your local terminal will open up, and pyhton shell is ready to use.
3. type '**help**' in the terminal to see what command it supports and use it.
4. All Set :)
